# Appearance

## Berth labels on the water

```csharp
marina.BerthLabelMode = BerthLabelMode.NonOccupied;
```

| `BerthLabelMode` | Labeled berths |
|---|---|
| `None` (default) | None |
| `OnlyFree` | Free |
| `NonOccupied` | Free, Reserved, Temporarily Free |
| `All` | Every berth |

- **Text:** each labeled berth shows its `DisplayName` (its `Label`, or else its `Id`).
- **Placement:** flat on the water just past the berth's open (seaward) end.
- **Size:** at most 65% of the berth width and between 0.3 m and 1 m tall, so labels of neighboring berths stay apart.
- **Orientation:** the top of the text points away from the pier, so it reads upright to someone on the pier looking at the berth.
- **Colors:** white; yellow while the berth is hovered or selected; gray for disabled berths.
- **Waves:** the text sits just above the highest point the waves can reach (the sum of wave amplitudes × `Water.WaveAmplitude`), so waves never cover it from any camera position.
- **Which berths:** hidden and filtered-out berths get no label.
- **Characters:** labels use a built-in stroke font (no textures) covering `A–Z`, `0–9` and `- _ + . , : / ( ) # ?`. Lowercase is drawn as uppercase and other characters as `?`.

`BerthLabelModeExtensions.Includes(mode, status)` and `GetDisplayName(mode)` help build a mode picker.

## Status colors and overlays

See [Berth status, boats and flags → Colors](04-status-and-flags.md#colors): `SetStatusColor`, `SetDisabledColor`, `SetOverlayOpacity`, `ResetStatusColors`.

`ColorRgba` is a linear RGBA color (0–1):

```csharp
var c1 = ColorRgba.FromHex("#3A73E8");          // #RGB, #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA
var c2 = ColorRgba.FromBytes(58, 115, 232);
var c3 = new ColorRgba(0.2f, 0.45f, 0.9f).WithAlpha(0.5f);
string hex = c1.ToHex();
```

## Lighting

`marina.Lighting` (`LightingSettings`), applied on the next frame:

| Property | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SunDirection` | (0.45, 0.8, 0.35), normalized | Unit vector toward the sun |
| `SetSunAngles(azimuth, elevation)` | | Sets `SunDirection` from compass angles |
| `SunColor` | (1, 0.95, 0.86) | Sunlight color |
| `AmbientColor` | (0.36, 0.40, 0.48) | Ambient light |
| `SpecularStrength`, `Shininess` | 0.35, 32 | Highlights on objects |
| `SkyColor` | (0.56, 0.72, 0.88) | Reflected by the water at grazing angles |
| `FogColor` | (0.76, 0.85, 0.92) | Horizon color and background |
| `FogDensity` | 0.0022 | Squared-exponential fog; 0 disables it |

```csharp
marina.Lighting.SetSunAngles(azimuthDegrees: 250, elevationDegrees: 12);   // evening light
marina.Lighting.SunColor = new Vector3(1.0f, 0.75f, 0.55f);
```

## Water

`marina.Water` (`WaterSettings`):

| Property | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Size` | 1400 m | Grid edge length. Set at construction only (`MarinaVisualizerOptions.Water`) |
| `GridResolution` | 160 | Cells per side. Construction only |
| `DeepColor`, `ShallowColor` | teal tones | Water body colors |
| `WaveAmplitude` | 0.08 m | Base wave height |
| `WaveFrequency` | 1 | Larger means shorter waves |
| `WaveSpeed` | 1 | 0 freezes the water and floating objects |

```csharp
var marina = new MarinaVisualizer(new MarinaVisualizerOptions
{
    Water = new WaterSettings { Size = 2400, GridResolution = 240, WaveAmplitude = 0.05f },
});
marina.Water.WaveSpeed = 0;   // calm, static water
```

The water grid is re-centered on the layout by `InitializeLayout`.

## Replacing boat models

Boats are procedural low-poly placeholders (`BoatMeshFactory`). To use your own models:
1. Load them into a `MeshData` in the same model space:
   - bow toward **+Z** and waterline at **Y = 0**, centered on X/Z;
   - authored at the nominal dimensions from `BoatTypeCatalog.GetNominalDimensions`.
2. Register each one under the boat type's id.

```csharp
// Interleaved vertices: position xyz, normal xyz, color rgb (MeshData.VertexStride = 9); uint triangle indices.
marina.Meshes.Register(new MeshData(MeshIds.ForBoat(BoatType.MotorYacht), "Yacht.gltf", vertices, indices));
```

Both renderers re-upload changed meshes automatically (`MeshLibrary.Version`). `MeshBuilder` helps build meshes from boxes, lofts, cylinders, spheres and plates. The procedural models use `MeshBuilder` too.

| `MeshIds` | Mesh |
|---|---|
| `Water` | Water grid |
| `UnitBox` | 1 m cube (decks, fingers, land) |
| `Piling` | Wooden piling |
| `BerthPad` | Status pad quad |
| `SelectionMarker` | Selection marker |
| `Buoy` | Sphere (buoys, boom floats) |
| `Cylinder` | Cylinder (steel piles, bollards) |
| `ForBoat(type)` | Boat models (100 + type) |
| `GlyphBase` + n | Label glyphs |
